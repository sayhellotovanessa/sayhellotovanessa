2016 has done a good job in bringing back my old passions.I bough an ukulele and started to practice harmonica again. +2 hearts to me. Now I want to have a melodica - because I like unsual instruments that I can easily carry to everywhere, even though I never do. But this year will be THE YEAR.
To be more at home, of course. I will finally buy a new turntable needle! (yes, this is a new year's resolution).
I brough my turntable from Brazil - and my LP records as well - but I was not able to listen to my LPs so far. The stylus was not working :( I don't know if something happened during the transport journey, but probably yes.
It made me use Spotify much more at home, which also made me recently discover this awesome project:

Yes, a music collection for programming. There is a list, most of the artists are in Soundcloud or Bandcamp, and their music is avaiable online for free. You can say that it is easy to find similar playlists on Deezer or Spotify, but these ones are fresh new and free.
I strongly recommend.
