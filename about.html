<p>Hello. I am <strong>Vanessa Guedes</strong>, a front-end developer with some background in project management.</p>
<p>Originally from Brazil, currently I work at <a href="http://accenture.com">Accenture Nordics</a>, in Stockholm, Sweden, as a Frontend Specialist. </p>


<h2>A passionate developer</h2>

I believe that sharing knowledge and distributing information are powerful things. That is why I've chosen to work with web development.
So, I strongly believe that making these things accessible to everybody is the developer's responsability.

<h2>What do I do?</h2>

I've being working with the full frontend-package lately. Javascript (from vanilla js to all sorts of libraries and frameworks), CSS (Sass, LESS, etc) and HTML (preprocessors, templates etc).
Nothing different from the traditional. I enjoy creating weird and uncommon side-projects when I want to play around with frontend.

I have also worked with PHP and Python in some projects, and currently I am enjoying to learn Golang.
