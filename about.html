<p>
  I am a Brazilian developer who lives in Sweden. Currently working at <a href="www.britny.se">Britny</a>, in Stockholm - where I live with my cats, my books and my partner. I work mostly as a front-end but also have some experience with project management.
  There are many things that I like in the IT area but above all them is the possibility to make people's lives easier. That is why I work as a web developer. I believe that the information should be acessible for everybody in the whole world.
  My work is mostly based on using open source projects, frameworks and languages.
</p>

<p>
  I appreciate working with people who truly believe in what they are doing with their time every day, not only thinking that 'time is money'. Because time is your life.
  I like to apply some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethics</a> to my carrer as well:

  <ul>
    <li>Sharing</li>
    <li>Openess</li>
    <li>Decentralization</li>
    <li>World improvement</li>
  </ul>
