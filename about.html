<h1>Since 2006 trying to avoid the float property.</h1>
<h2>But always loving markdown.</h2>
<p>Hello. I am Vanessa Guedes, a front-end developer with some background in education and project management.</p>
<p>Originally from Brazil, currently I work at <a href="http://britny.se">Britny</a>, in Stockholm, Sweden. I am sure they hired me because I told them that I am a Linux fangirl. And that is true. </p>

<h2>A passionate by technology and people.</h2>

I work with IT because I believe that sharing knowledge and distributing information are powerful things.
And making it accessible to everybody is the developer's responsability.


<h2>Some skills would be good to show off.</h2>

I love CSS animations and I can spend many hours working on strange ideas about drawing on the screen via code.
Of course I have some experience with JavaScript, speacially JQuery, but I must say that vanilla js makes me a little bit happier.
I also like the shell - not the ones in the sea, but that dark and dull command line interpreter - and have my own CLI aliases.
When working, I use Atom as my code editor and some Linux distribution as my OS (it always depends on the last releases and how much interested I am
in some new distro).

I have worked with Wordpress and PHP stuff for many years, but now I am trying to focus on other type of projects. I am very interested in Python and Golang.
