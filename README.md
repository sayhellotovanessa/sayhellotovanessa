# üèÜ ‚Äì This is a Jekyll blog
Created with Jekyll (srly) and using [Trophy]((https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy/) theme as a base (which was based on Hyde, if I am not wrong). Possibly hosted by Github in a few minutes, as soon as I finish it tonight.
Feel free to clone or download and use as your own personal blog.

To install it properly you must have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in your machine. Then you just create a new folder in your local files, clone this repo and run:

````bundle install````

And then:

````bundle exec jekyll serve````

Of course this is too hipster to be registered in RubyGems, so you need to trust me and install as it is.

Good luck!
